msgid "We believe the problem could be solved by the use of several free and open source programs, available both for GNU/Linux, Mac OSX and MS Windows operating systems. We aim at producing the most advanced software; our indicative term of reference is `Animal Movements <http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/USGS_animal_mvmt.html>`_ (which requires the expensive, obsolete, and proprietary ArcView + Spatial Analyst proprietary packages)."

msgid "Another approach is to use plain QGIS_ to run many useful analyses (e.g. basic statistics, Minimum Convex Polygon). Fom more advanced analyses, we have developed some *ad hoc* plugins."
